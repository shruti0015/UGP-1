Amplitude pitching control mechanism for VAWT

The primary objective of this research is to investigate how alterations in the linkage length 
impact the pitch amplitude of the turbine blades, ultimately optimizing the energy output of the 
VAWT. The simulation phase employs simple Python code with the help of some mathematical
formula derivations. The study aims to establish a correlation between linkage parameters and pitch amplitudes by systematically varying linkage lengths, providing crucial insights for optimizing VAWT performance.
